# Image Processing with OpenCV for the swelling studies of responsive hydrogels with host-guest interactions.
Calculation of an object area (hydrogel) using its image with a reference object with a known size.

This repository includes a jupyter notebook with the code for the object area calculations.
For the detailed information see comments in the code.

The program was used to determine the change in size (swelling/deswelling) of responsive hydrogels 
in dependence of the response to the irradiation with UV or visible light.
